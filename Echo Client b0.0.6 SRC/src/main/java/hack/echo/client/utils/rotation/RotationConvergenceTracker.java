/**
 * Tracks the per-tick yaw/pitch delta from the previous tick for use in Grim
 * DuplicateRotPlace bypass: the check gates on {@code deltaX > 2}, so as long as
 * we only fire interactions on a tick where last tick's delta was small, we
 * never trip the check regardless of what {@code lastPlacedDeltaX} held.
 *
 * <p>{@link #update()} must be called at HEAD of every {@code onTick} (before
 * {@code MouseHandler.turnPlayer} applies this tick's rotation). It records both
 * the visible player rotation and the server-side silent rotation so
 * {@link #isSettled} can pick whichever is actually being sent this tick.
